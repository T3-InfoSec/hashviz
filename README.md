# hashviz
This repository is an opiniated codification of general theory around Hash Visualization - specifically for authentication and identification systems, to guide implementations of HashViz which will be referenced below as they emerge.

Our purpose is to push forward an easy to use, safe, versatile and configurable approach to hash visualizations in multiple languages. This work and research emerges through our intention for using this in both the Great Wall protocol and T3 Vault applications, bringing self-custodial, coercion resistant and tacit knowledge based information and digital asset storage.

We stand on the shoulders of giants, when it comes to Hash Visualization there are many research papers and proposals that we build upon and are inspired by. Documentation will be in the papers folder, and we will appropriately give credits to the respective authors we are influenced by.
